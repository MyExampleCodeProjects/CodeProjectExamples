About:

"main.py" is a script I quickly wrote to help solve a data sorting problem. I have included it as an example of my Python knoweldge. 
My father volunteers at a foodbank and needed to sort through their bank tranfer spreadsheet and match donations to their personal contacts details spreadsheet to indentify gift aiders.
This is a time consuming task and he found it hard to do using excel so we exported the spreadsheet to the .csv format and I wrote a script to automate the task. 
I have not been able to include the relvant .csv files in this download as they contain personal data but would be happy to provide dummy files to demonstate how this script works if requested to do so. 

The Script:

The script (lines 10-26) finds people from the contacts sheet who are gift aiders.
The next step (lines 27-70) finds bank transfers from these gift aiders and combines their contact details and bank transfters into a .csv file that shows their total donations over a tax year.

Usage: 

Made in PyCharm 2020.2.5 (I have not included the .csv files the script uses since they contain personal infomation)
Intended as an example to be viewed in a text editor such as notepad.
