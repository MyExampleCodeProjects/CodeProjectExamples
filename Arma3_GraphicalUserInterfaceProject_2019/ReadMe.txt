About:

The following contains files intended to show that I am able to learn new coding skills on my own through the use of Wikis and Guides. 
Arma 3 is a game I have played with freinds for several years. I have made several scripts, 3D models and Game Modes for this game.
The example contained within the folder "BW_PLM.Altis" is an example of a Script/Graphical User Interface I designed for the game.

My Work:

All files in the BW_PLM.Altis where written by myself. 
The scirpt/gui allows players to edit a vehicle in game. 
The scirpt/gui allows fuel and health to be restored as well as the user to change a vehicle weapon's loadout.
These features are not avalible in the game by default.

The file contains scripts written in the game's scripting lanuge called Status Quo Function (.sqf file extension)

Style Sheets (SS) and Graphical Users Interfaces (GUIs) are contained in header files with the extension .ext,.h,.hpp 
These GUIs and SS are loaded before the start of a game through the description.ext file and are located within the BW_PLM folder.
